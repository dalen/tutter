# Tutter (WIP)

## Features to implement

* Add Web api hook automatically
* Ability to set how many +1 that's required
* Merge/Close if amount of +1 sufficient and comment include "shipit"
* Support multiple projects (api token per project)

Pull Request -> Built automatically by Jenkins -> Jenkins Says OK ->
User X says +1 -> User Y says merge -> Merge code
